# use genomepy (already installed) and download all available files, usually including:
- one ref.fa
- one ref.fa.tar (one fa for reach chrom)
- several .gtf files

# what might be missing: 
- .bed file:
	- either make from the .gtf 
	- or use the circexplorer included tool to download this aswell
	- alternatively: use the ucsc table browser or the goldepath
